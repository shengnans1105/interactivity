## Dataset

```{r}
airbnb_data = read_csv("./data/nyc_airbnb.zip") %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  mutate(rating = review_scores_location / 2) %>%
  select(boro = neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, rating, price, room_type,
         latitude, longitude) %>%
  filter(boro == "Manhattan",
         room_type == "Entire home/apt",
         price %in% 100:400)  
```

## Plotly Scatterplot

```{r}
airbnb_data %>%
  mutate(text_label = str_c("Price: $", price, '\nRating: ', rating)) %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~longitude, y = ~latitude, type = "scatter", mode = "markers",
          alpha = 0.5, 
          color = ~price,
          text = ~text_label)
```

## Plotly boxplot

```{r}
airbnb_data %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~neighbourhood, y = ~price, type = "box")

airbnb_data %>%
  mutate(neighbourhood = fct_reorder(neighbourhood, price)) %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~neighbourhood, y = ~price, type = "box")

airbnb_data %>%
  mutate(neighbourhood = fct_reorder(neighbourhood, price)) %>%
  plot_ly(color = ~neighbourhood, y = ~price, type = "box", colors = "Set2")
```

## Plotly bar chart

```{r}
airbnb_data %>% 
  count(neighbourhood) %>% 
  mutate(neighbourhood = fct_reorder(neighbourhood, n)) %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~neighbourhood, y = ~n, color = ~neighbourhood, type = "bar")
```

## ggplotly

```{r}

  ggplot(aes(x = longitude, y = latitude, color = price)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.25) +
  scale_color_viridis() +
